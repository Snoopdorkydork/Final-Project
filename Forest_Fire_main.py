Aim:- The aim of the code is to predict the likelyhood of forest fires
given the weather conditions.
Logic behind the code: The code uses 4 algorithms to predict forest fire. The user can chose either or all of
the algorithms to predict fire. 

This is the main part of the program asking user input and giving the desired output.

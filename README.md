# Final-Project
This Repository is the final project for Software carpentry course.
Forest Fires are rampant in the world and we have created a program to predict fire so actions can 
be taken in advance for its prevention.

The user should have pr download the following python packages to run the program:
1. pandas
2. sklearn
3. pickle
4. scipy
5. numpy
6. pyglet
To run the file, the user should download all the files in Final Project and run Forest_Fire_main.py

We use 4 models and the user can choose either or all of the models to predict the Fire. The models
used are as follows:
1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Support Vector Classifier                                  
3. Multi Level Perceptron Classifier                           
4. Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier                             

For predicting the fire using the models mentioned above, user is asked to input various input values.
The values asked are for the various attributes which are responsible for forest fire. The attributes are as follows:
1. Temperature
2. Relative Humidity (RH)
3. Wind speed
4. Rain
5. Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) 
6. Duff Moisture Code (DMC) 
7. Drought Code (DC) 
8. Initial Spread Index (ISI) 
9. Buildup Index (BUI)
10. 10.Fire Weather Index (FWI)

Our output, fire prediction - " Fire" or " No Fire" is displayed in written form in the console as well as in the form of a  fun gif.

Reach out to us, if you have any doubts or would like to make any suggestions. Thank you!
